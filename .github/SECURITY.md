# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As an open source product, only  the latest major version will be patched for security vulnerabilities. Previous versions of Loguru will likely not be retroactively patched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email delgan.py@gmail.com with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.

Once the vulnerability has been confirmed, it will be fixed as soon as possible if feasible. Alternatively, mitigating solutions will be detailed in the documentation: [Security considerations when using Loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/recipes.html#security-considerations-when-using-loguru).
